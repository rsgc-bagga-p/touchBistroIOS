  - Initialized Collection View
  - Added edit button and full application designed
  - Adding menu items

Attempted:
  - Deleting items, does not work
  - Listing menu items (issue pulling data using menu group as key)
  - Adding images

Not Attempted: 
  - Editing entries
  - UI constraints

Features:
  - Collectionview with nicely desinged cells
  - Data model with relationships

Notes for Testing:
  - App fully runs, use iPhone 7 to simulate for the best results
  - Currently pressing on the cells in the group menu collection view will break the program, there are issues with fetching
  - The plus button will open a menu where you can add things to core data
  - Going back will automatically reload the view and add the new cells
